## Datamart Design Mini Project

This repository contains the mini project for the Data Engineer position test on designing a DataMart for TopCV. The project is developed by Bui Huy Thai.

### Project Overview

The objective of this mini project is to demonstrate the ability to design and implement an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to transfer data from an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database (SQL Server) to a DataMart (SQL Server). The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that contains the ETL jobs and a SQL file that consists of four query statements for data retrieval based on the test requirements.
